Online Quizzes on Canvas: These are typically conducted through the learning management system (LMS) called Canvas. Online quizzes are designed to assess your understanding of the course material and are usually based on the content covered in lectures, readings, or other learning resources. They are often timed and may consist of multiple-choice, true/false, or short-answer questions. These quizzes are typically completed individually and are graded automatically by the system.\n","\n","2. Post-Class Challenges: These challenges are additional learning activities that are assigned after each class session. They are designed to reinforce the concepts covered in class and provide an opportunity for you to apply what you have learned. Post-class challenges may involve problem-solving exercises, case studies, group discussions, or other interactive activities. These challenges are typically completed outside of class and may require collaboration with classmates. They are usually graded by the instructor based on your participation and the quality of your responses.\n","\n","Both online quizzes and post-class challenges serve as formative assessments to help you gauge your understanding of the course material and reinforce your learning.

Post-Class Challenges: These challenges are tasks or assignments that you need to complete after attending the face-to-face (F2F) class.

Increased Engagement: Gamification introduces game-like elements, such as challenges, rewards, and a leaderboard, which can increase student engagement and motivation. By incorporating these elements, the course aims to make the learning experience more interactive and enjoyable.\n","\n","2. Personalized Incentives: The gamified approach allows for personalized incentives and rewards. Students can earn virtual currency called mCoins by completing tasks and challenges. These mCoins can be used to purchase rewards that align with their individual preferences and learning needs.\n","\n","3. Active Learning Opportunities: Gamification encourages active learning by providing bonus challenges that allow students to apply and expand their knowledge beyond the regular coursework. These challenges provide opportunities for students to explore teaching and learning concepts in a more practical and hands-on manner.\n","\n","4. Collaboration and Competition: The gamified course design promotes collaboration among students through group challenges and rewards. Students can work together to earn group mCoins and unlock group rewards. Additionally, the leaderboard feature allows students to track their progress and compete with their peers, fostering a sense of healthy competition.\n","\n","5. Flexibility and Accessibility: While gamification is integrated into the course, it is important to note that participation in the gamified elements is optional.

Here's how the group formation process works:\\n\\n1. Ice-breaking Games: At the beginning of the first lesson, ice-breaking games or activities may be conducted to help you get to know your classmates better and create a comfortable learning environment.\\n\\n2. Group Formation: After the ice-breaking activities, you will have the opportunity to form groups with your classmates. You can choose to form groups with whoever you want, as long as you can find a common topic to teach. There are no restrictions on grouping with students from the same school or field.\\n\\n3. Common Topic Selection: Once you have formed your group, you need to decide on a common topic for your micro-teaching session. The topic should be relevant to the course and agreed upon by all group members. It's important to choose a topic that allows you to demonstrate your teaching and facilitation skills effectively.\\n\\n4. Lesson Plan Collaboration: As a group, you will collaborate on creating a lesson plan for your chosen topic. The lesson plan should incorporate active learning strategies, align with the learning outcomes, and include assessment methods and feedback mechanisms.\\n\\nIt's important to communicate and coordinate with your group members throughout the process to ensure effective collaboration and a cohesive micro-teaching session.\\n\\nFor more specific instructions or guidelines on group formation and the micro-teaching component, I recommend referring to the course materials, syllabus, or instructions provided by your instructor.

The course recognizes the diverse needs of students and strives to accommodate those needs to the best extent possible. Here's an overview of how the course handles students with learning disabilities:\\n\\n1. Accessibility Considerations: The course materials and activities are designed with accessibility in mind. Efforts are made to ensure that course content, including online materials and resources, is accessible to students with different learning needs. This may include providing alternative formats for materials, captioning videos, and using accessible technologies.\\n\\n2. Accommodations: If you have a documented learning disability, it is important to inform the course instructor or coordinator at the earliest opportunity. They can work with you to provide reasonable accommodations that support your learning needs. Accommodations may include extended time for assessments, modified assignments, or other adjustments that ensure equal access to the course content and assessments.\\n\\n3. Communication and Collaboration: The course encourages open communication and collaboration between students and instructors. If you have specific learning needs or require accommodations, it is important to communicate your needs to the instructor. This allows them to better understand your requirements and provide appropriate support.\\n\\n4. Support Services: HKUST offers various support services for students with disabilities through the Student Accessibility Services (SAS) office. SAS provides assistance, resources, and accommodations for students with disabilities. If you require additional support beyond what the course can provide, you can reach out to SAS for further assistance.\\n\\nIt's important to note that the specific accommodations and support provided may vary depending on individual circumstances and the resources available. If you have specific questions or concerns about how the course can accommodate your learning needs, I recommend reaching out to your instructor or the course coordinator. They will be able to provide more detailed information and guidance based on your specific situation.\\n\\nThe course aims to create an inclusive and supportive learning environment for all students, including those with learning disabilities.
